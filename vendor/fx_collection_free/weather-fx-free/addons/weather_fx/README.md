# Weather FX

34 animated 2D weather, sky and water effects for Godot 4.3+ (Forward+, Mobile, Compatibility). Each is
one shader drawn by one `WeatherFX` node: no textures, no particles.

**The full pack:** **[Weather FX](https://heyheythere.itch.io/weather-fx)** has all 34: lightning, storm clouds, a
tornado, a blizzard, hail, mist, the sun and moon, stars, meteors, an aurora, clouds, a rainbow, a lake
that reflects your scene with raindrop ripples, a waterfall, ash, embers, fireflies, pollen, a sandstorm,
wind, falling leaves, god rays, heat haze, frost and rain on the window, and a day-night cycle on top of
these three, and weather states for all of them. Same node, same code: install it over this one.

## Add one

```gdscript
var rain := WeatherFX.add(self, "rain")                   # covers the view, follows the camera
WeatherFX.add(self, "fog", {density = 0.8}).fade_in(3.0)
WeatherFX.add(self, "water", {position = Vector2(0, 500), size = Vector2(1280, 220)})
var storm := WeatherFX.add(self, "lightning", {frequency = 0.0})
storm.strike()                                            # a strike, now
rain.stop(2.0)                                            # fades out, then frees itself
```

Or add a WeatherFX node to a scene and pick `effect`. It previews in the editor, and its material
holds the uniforms.

## Effects

`WeatherFX.effects()` lists them all.

- Sky: stars, meteors, moon, sun, aurora, clouds, storm_clouds, rainbow, tornado
- Falling and blowing: rain, snow, blizzard, hail, leaves, ash, embers, fireflies, pollen, sandstorm,
  wind, bubbles
- Light and air: fog, mist, cloud_shadows, god_rays, heat_haze, lightning, caustics, day_night
- Water: ripples (rain rings on a surface; give it the water's rect), water and waterfall (rects,
  top-left corner at the node)
- On the screen: frost creeping in from the edges, rain_window (beads and runners on the glass)

Give any effect a `size` to draw it as a rect instead. Patterns are anchored to the world, so they
stay put when the camera moves.

## Options

Options go to `add()` or `set_option()`. A key that names a property of the node sets it, any other
key sets the shader uniform: see the material in the inspector for each effect's own (`density`,
`wind`, `color`, `fall_speed`, `time_of_day`...).

| option | | |
|---|---|---|
| `size` | node | rect in pixels; zero covers the view (water and waterfall have a default rect) |
| `pixel_size` | node | pixel-art mode: size of a pixel; -1 follows `WeatherFX.default_pixel_size` |
| `position`, `z_index`... | node | any Node2D property |
| `intensity` | shader | strength, 0..2; `fade_in()` and `stop()` drive it |
| `speed` | shader | animation speed |
| `seed` | shader | variation; `add()` picks a random one |
| `color_steps` | shader | posterize to N levels per channel |

## Layering

Draw order is node order, as listed in `WeatherFX.EFFECTS`: the sky first, water before rain,
day_night after the scene, rain_window last. Put your UI on a CanvasLayer
above the weather so day_night doesn't tint it.

Water, heat_haze and rain_window read the screen, and see what was drawn before them on a lower CanvasLayer
(or the same layer, before the first screen reader on it). Keep the level on layer 0 and put them on
a CanvasLayer at 1; heat_haze over water needs a layer of its own above the water, and rain_window
one above all the weather it should bend.

Rain splashes and hail bounces where they meet the `ground` uniform (0..1 down the view, 1 is off),
lightning strikes down to its own `ground` and a tornado touches down on it.

## Weather states

```gdscript
$Weather.change("storm", 6.0)                          # a WeatherSystem node, over 6 seconds
$Weather.forecast = {clear = 3, cloudy = 2, rain = 1}  # changes on its own every change_every seconds
```

A WeatherSystem adds a state's effects as its children and, on a change, fades out the ones the
next state doesn't have and fades in its new ones. `WeatherSystem.STATES` holds each state's effects
and options; `WeatherSystem.states()` lists the ones installed. `ground` sets where rain splashes and
lightning strikes, and `get_effect("lightning")` is its lightning, to `strike()`. Put it on a
CanvasLayer above the level, as the effects; heat_haze reads what is drawn before it there.

## Pixel art

```gdscript
WeatherFX.default_pixel_size = 4   # once, before adding effects
```

Effects then draw in 4x4 pixel blocks aligned to the world, with hard-edged alpha. Combine with
`color_steps` for a limited palette.
